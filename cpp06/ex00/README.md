## About <a name = "about"></a>

In this set of exercises we will learn about the different types of casting in C++, in the [Ex00](#Ex00) exercise we will be making a "Converter" for casting multiple types onto one another using ```static_cast```, on the [Ex01](#Ex01) exercise we will learn about ```Reinterpret cast``` and lastly we will dive into the topic of ```dynamic_cast``` in the [Ex02](#Ex02).

_DISCLAIMER_Â \
It is worth noting that this guide is simply my own review on the topics in base of what the tasks for each exercises lead me to do research on, that means this are  over simplified notions of the topics and by no means a complete lecture on Type casting.
