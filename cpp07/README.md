## About <a name = "about"></a>

In this set of exercises we will learn about Templates and their basic uses in C++, in the [Ex00](#Ex00) exercise we will create simple ```Function Templates``` in order to get use to the syntax and the way to call our templates in a program, on the [Ex01](#Ex01) exercise we will impelement function templates to data type arrays, in order to serialize processes and apply actions (like printing the elements of an array) and lastly we will create a ```Class Template Array``` that creates an array of any data type in  [Ex02](#Ex02).

## Previous Notions <a name = "Previous notions"></a>

- C++ templates is a programming model that allows plugging-in of any data-type to the code (templated code). Without template, you would need to replicate same code all over again and again, for all required data-types. And obviously, as said before, it requires code maintenance. 
- Templates enable you to define the operations of a class or function, and let the user specify what concrete types those operations should work on.
- Templates create "Placeholders" for generic types, allowing serialization of code , flexibility and reusability.


C++ has 2 main uses of templates:

## Exercise 00: Start with a few functions <a name = "Ex00"></a>

This first exercise introduces us to the concept of ```Function Templates```, and the use and call of custom templates in our programs. So here is a short introduction and exemplification on how they work.

### ```Function Templates:```

Here is how the syntax of a [Function Template](#functiontemplate) is constructed:

1. We need to define our ```< Content >``` 

Where Content can be:
- class T / typename T. \
The use of ```<class TYPE>``` and ```<typename TYPE>``` for creating templates works the same way (so no need of getting confused like i did when i first saw it ;)).

- A data type, which maps to T\
The symbol T is nothing but some data-type, which can be any data-type, a basic datatype ```(int, double etc)```
- An integral specification
- An integral constant/pointer/reference which maps to specification mentioned above. 

2. Under our template declaration we write our Function as we normally would, like follows:
```c++
	template<class type>
	ret-type func-name(parameter list)
	{
		//body of the function
	}
```

## Syntax Example and usage
```c++
	//	We can the use our template with any data type we want 
	//	and the compiler will identify our input

	template<typename TYPE>
	void	printstuff(TYPE data)
	{
		std::cout << data<<std::endl;
	}

	int main(){
		printstuff(42);				//int
		printstuff(21.21);			//double
		printstuff('a');			// char
		printstuff("Hello World");	//string
	}
```
The first line of code ```template<class TYPE>```
tells the compiler that this is a function-template. The actual meaning of ```TYPE``` would be deduced by compiler depending on the argument passed to this function. Here, the name, ```TYPE``` is known as template type parameter.


## Exercise 01: Iter <a name = "Ex01"></a>
Now in this exercise lets use the learned concepts into iterating the work of a function and implementing it into an array of elements.

For this we can implement as before a template over a function and pass a function as a parameter and the rest of the elements requested by the task (the address and length of the array)

```c++
	template< typename T>
	void	iter(T *array, int arrayLength, void myFunction(T const &ref)){

		// for every element in the array apply your custom function
		for(int i = 0; i < arrayLength; i++)
			myFunc(array[i]);
	}
```

## Exercise 02: Identify real type <a name = "Ex02"></a>

Now we can implement the concept of Templates into a Class, and that is what the exercise is about, to create a class array that creates and initializes an array using templates in order to create arrays of any type.

for a better understanding this is a short view on how ```Class Templates``` work.

### ```Classes Templates:```

More often, you would design and use class templates, than function templates. In general, you use a class template to define an abstract type whose behavior is generic and is reusable, adaptable.

## Syntax Example and usage

```c++
	#include <iostream> 
	using namespace std; 
	
	template <class T> 
	class Test{ 
	// Data memnbers of test 
		public: 
		   Test() 
		   { 
		       // Initialization of data members 
		       cout << "General template  \n"; 
		   } 
		   // Other methods of Test 
	}; 
	
	template <class T> 
	class Test <int> 
	{ 
	public: 
	   Test() 
	   { 
	       // Initialization of data members 
	       cout << "Specialized template \n"; 
	   } 
	}; 
	
	int main() 
	{ 
	    Test<int> a; 
	    Test<char> b; 
	    Test<float> c; 
	    return 0; 
	} 

// and the class template declaration starts with same syntax as function templates:

	template<class T>
	class Item
```
Note that the keyword ```class``` is used two times - firstly to specify template type specification (T), and secondly to specify that this is a C++ class declaration.
